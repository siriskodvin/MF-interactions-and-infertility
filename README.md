Male-female genetic interaction associated with infertility

With data from the START project, simple case-control GWAS scans for fertility-related 
genes can be performed by comparing ART-mothers with non-ART mothers, as well as 
comparing ART-fathers with non-ART fathers. Such a procedure has the possibility of 
revealing fertility related genes in the mother and the father, separately. Initially, we will 
perform separate GWAS case-control scans for the mother and the father. In addition, we 
will extend the statistical model to also look for SNP-wise interactions between the mother 
and the father. Since fertility issues may well be related to the couple, not only to the mother 
or father alone, the ability of achieving a successful pregnancy may be influenced by 
“incompatible” genes in the mother and the father, possibly revealed through interactions. 
This can be implemented by extending the standard case-control GWAS methods to include 
SNP-SNP interactions, which will reveal possible combinations of SNP alleles that increase 
chances of ART treatment.
